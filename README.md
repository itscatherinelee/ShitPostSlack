# ShitPostSlack
I made a thing that will help me shit post in my slack channels better.

okay so to run the script you need two things:
1. your text that you want to write
  * "ok boomer"
  * "yeet"
  * "hello"
2. your favorite emoji
  * 👏
  * 😡
  * 💁‍♀️
 
great! now you have the two arguments, write out:
<pre><code> python Emoji.py "yeet" ":clap:" </code></pre>
